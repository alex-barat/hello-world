GitHub tutorial

I enjoy reading about technology, about the latest discoveries or advances in technology and science. I also like software, and at the moment I enjoy reading and learning new technologies and practices that should make writing software more enjoyable and efficient to me. I have to say that I've missed a lot but it's so fun learning about it. Unfortunately, I also get bored easily and need to keep engaged in order to be productive - I think working with like-minded people will take care of that. :)
